How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```jsd6-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```jsd6-homework/Sasha-svodnik```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework #2: `jsd6-homework/Sasha-svodnik/hw_2/hubot.js`

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- code/   
        |-- jsd6-homework/
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- hw_1/
                    |- bottlesOfBeer.js
